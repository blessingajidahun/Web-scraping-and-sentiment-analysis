##  Research Summary & Key Findings

This research is centered on the analysis of **7,760 articles** sourced from the *BusinessDay Nigeria* website, a reputable media outlet known for its coverage of Nigeria’s financial and economic landscape.

### Sentiment Distribution

After preprocessing and sentiment analysis, the articles were classified into the following categories:

| Sentiment | Article Count | Percentage |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Positive  | 3,038          | 39.1%      |
| Neutral   | 3,007          | 38.8%      |
| Negative  | 1,715          | 22.1%      |

###  Interpretation

- A **significant proportion (78%)** of the articles were either **positive or neutral** in sentiment, suggesting that the media tone around Nigeria’s economy tends to be **optimistic or balanced** rather than pessimistic.
- **Positive sentiment (39.1%)** was the most dominant, indicating frequent media coverage on growth, investment, reforms, or other favorable economic events.
- **Neutral sentiment (38.8%)** shows that many articles were objective or informative without strong emotional language.
- **Negative sentiment (22.1%)**, while the least, still represents a considerable portion, likely highlighting challenges such as inflation, debt, unemployment, or political instability.

These findings help paint a data-driven picture of how economic issues are communicated in the media and can serve as a proxy for public or investor confidence in Nigeria’s economic direction over the past few years.
